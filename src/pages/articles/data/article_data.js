      "FinCEN Anti-Money Laundering Customer Identification Program Rulemaking",
    date: "Sep 14th, 2020",
    name: "fincen-anti-money-laundering",
    content: `
    Today, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), announced final rulemaking on anti-money laundering (AML) customer identification program (CIP) requirements for banks not subject to federal functional regulator supervision. This new rulemaking subjects those non-supervised banks to the same CIP requirements imposed on regulated banks. Non-bank organizations like loan and finance companies have not been subject to CIP requirements, and remain so.

    This final rule only affects banks that are not regulated by the federal functional regulators, which include: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Banks supervised by the preceding regulators have already been subject to CIP requirements as part of their anti-money laundering (AML) compliance programs, those not supervised are now subject to the same AML CIP requirements.

    Under the USA Patriot Act, all covered financial institution must take reasonable steps to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of, and the source of funds deposited into, private banking accounts, as necessary to guard against money laundering and to report suspicious transactions. Enhanced scrutiny reasonably designed to detect and report transactions that may involve the proceeds of foreign corruption must be applied to private banking accounts requested or maintained for, or on behalf of, senior foreign political figures, including family members or close associates. These requirements have applied to most banks since 2002. This final rule will remove the exemption for banks not subject to regulation by a federal functional regulator.

    This final rule is similar to the removal of exemption from loan and finance companies that subjected non-bank mortgage companies to AML program requirements. However, the rules for loan and finance companies do not include CIP requirements, these rules for non-supervised banks do include CIP requirements.

    Banks must endeavor to obtain the following from prospective customers prior to opening an account: name, address, identification number, and date of birth for individuals. The identification number must be a U.S. taxpayer identification number for U.S. persons. Non-U.S. persons may provide identification numbers from U.S. taxpayer identification number, passport number and country of issuance, or other government-issued identification bearing a photograph or similarly safeguarded document evidencing nationality or residence.

    Non-documentary methods of customer identification may also be included in the overall CIP. The CIP policy must address the bank's response to circumstances in which the bank cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customer.

    The general authority for this rulemaking comes from the USA Patriot Act and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). FinCEN carries out BSA/AML rulemaking and adminisrative functions for the U.S. Department of Treasury.

    title: "Oregon's forbearance and foreclosure moratorium extended",
    date: "Aug 31st, 2020",
    name: "oregon-forbearance-and-foreclosure",
    content: `
    Oregon Gov. Kate Brown issued Executive Order 20-37 today extending the emergency period under HB 4204 through December 31, 2020. The emergency period previously ran from March 8th through September 30. HB 4204 imposes mortgage payment forbearance requirements and foreclosure moratorium on all real property loans.

    Today's extension of the emergency period raises questions about ongoing notification of rights to accommodations required to be sent by each lender to all borrowers within 60 days of the effective date (June 30th) making the deadline two days ago (August 29th). Most conforming first lien loans have first payment due date the first day of the month after the month in which the loan closed. Before the extension, that had the effect of mooting notice for loans closed after the notice deadline, because the first payments were not due until October 1st and the emergency period tentatively expired September 30. However, with the extension, loans originated after the notice deadline will have payments subject to the law.

    The law is arguably silent with respect to future loan originations because it requires notice after 60 days of taking affect without addressing future borrowers. However, it does say each lender must provide notice to all borrowers. A court could rule either way, holding that future borrowers would have sufficient notice by the law being in place for a longer period of time, or that the intent was for all borrowers to receive notice. Residential mortgage regulators could also view failure to provide notice as an unfair, deceptive, or abusive practice, though that would be an aggressive policy stance. Oregon's Department of Consumer and Business Services, Division of Financial Regulation, published guidance related to HB 4204 earlier this month. However, it did not address whether it expected lenders to provide notice to borrowers for loans made after the 60 day notice deadline.
    The state has not filed an answer yet, in the complaint filed by the Oregon Bankers Association challenging the constitutionality of HB 4204 and arguing preemption for banks. The action was filed in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from HB 4204's notice and forbearance provisions, but does not challenge the foreclosure moratorium provisions.

    title: "Oregon's Sweeping Forbearance & Foreclosure Moratorium Law",
    date: "July 1st, 2020",
    name: "oregon-sweeping-forebearance-foreclosure-moratorium",
    content: `
    June 30, 2020, Oregon Governor, Kate Brown, signed sweeping mortgage payment forbearance and foreclosure moratorium provisions into law. Virtually all loans secured by real property and certain installment contracts secured by personal property used as a residence in Oregon are covered, including but not limited to 1-4 family residential, multifamily residential, bare land, and commercial properties. Oregon lenders must provide written notice to borrowers of their right to accommodations. Additionally, if designated by an executive order of the governor on or before August 31st, the end date for the emergency period may be extended beyond the designated emergency period that runs from March 8th to September 30, 2020.

    This article addresses highlights of the lender notice requirement, forbearance requirements, borrower qualification for forbearance, the foreclosure moratorium, and borrower damages.

    # Lenders must notify borrowers of right to accommodation

    By August 29th, “each lender” must provide notice to borrowers of their right to accommodation. The form of the notice is not prescribed.

    “Lender” is broadly defined to include both trustees and beneficiaries of trust deeds, mortgagees on mortgages, persons licensed under Oregon’s Mortgage Lender Law, and sellers under land sale contracts or retail installment contracts secured by personal property used as a residence. Lender also includes “an agent, affiliate or employee of a beneficiary, trustee, mortgagee, seller, retail seller or licensee.” Because each lender is required to provide written notice of accommodation, a literal interpretation would result in borrowers receiving notice from every employee, agent, and affiliate of the organization that actually made the loan. The definition also fails to distinguish between an originator and a servicer, and suggests an originator may have an obligation to mail written notice to borrowers even if the loan will be sold before the first payment is due. Similarly, a broker that table funds or is deemed an agent of the lender could be obligated to mail written notice.

    While requiring every employee to send a letter would be an absurd interpretation, we do advise agents, affiliates, and trustees to mail written notice when they have had or anticipate reason to initiate mortgage related communications with the borrower during the emergency period. We advise brokers and correspondent lenders that will not service loans, to document that their investor or servicer has indicated it is mailing the notice to justify their inaction.

    # Forbearance Requirements

    “During the emergency period, a lender may not treat as a default a borrower’s failure to make a periodic installment payment or to pay any other amount that is due to the lender on or in connection with an obligation that is subject to a financing agreement 1 if at any time during the emergency period the borrower notifies the lender that the borrower will not be able to make the periodic installment payment.” Because the emergency period began on March 8, and “a borrower does not need to provide a notification to a lender… more than once,” the language suggests borrower notification of a COVID related inability to make a payment is effective even if it occurred prior to the passage and effective date of the law.

    A lender must:

    1. Defer collection of the periodic installment payment during the emergency period and permit the borrower to pay the deferred amount at the scheduled or anticipated date on which full performance of the obligation is due, but “only if the lender and borrower do not otherwise agree to modify, defer or otherwise mitigate the loan.” A lender’s power to negotiate this is greatly reduced by its obligation to provide the written notice of a borrower’s right to accommodation. Intimidating a borrower into a shorter repayment period would likely be deemed an unfair practice, as might omitting that notice during oral communications negotiating an alternative repayment. However, lenders are explicitly permitted to adjust escrow impounds pursuant to RESPA, which is appropriate as these amounts are not due to the lender.

    A lender may not:

    1. Impose or collect charges, fees, penalties, attorney fees or other amounts that might have been imposed or collected for failing, during the emergency period, to make a payment or failure to pay another amount due on or in connection with the obligation;

    2. Impose a default rate of interest that might have been imposed or collected for failing, during the emergency period, to make a payment or failure to pay another amount due on or in connection with the obligation;

    3. Treat in any manner the failure, during the emergency period, to make a payment or failure to pay another amount due on or in connection with the obligation as an ineligibility for a foreclosure avoidance measure;

    4. Require or charge for an inspection, appraisal or a broker opinion of value, not otherwise permitted in the absence of a default;

    5. Declare a default based on the failure of a borrower to meet financial covenants due to inadequate operating revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

    6. Initiate or implement cash management or lockbox procedures or take control of operating revenue from real property security, unless the procedures or control was already in existence before June 30, 2020; or

    7. Declare a default based on the Borrower’s failure to meet financial covenants due to inadequate operating revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

    # Qualification for Forbearance

    A borrower on 1-4 unit residential properties “must attest that the borrower’s failure to pay is a result of a loss of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic.” Here, the “failure to pay” language is different from inability to pay and, while not without defenses, may suggest that a borrower can benefit from these provisions when notification is made after the payment becomes delinquent. This suggests that payments previously missed could be argued to be covered even if the consumer's notice is not given until some time in the future (though still within the emergency period).

    “If the subject property is commercial property or residential property with more than four dwelling units, the notification must include financial statements or other evidence that demonstrates a loss of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic and must disclose any funds the borrower received from the United States Small Business Administration under the Paycheck Protection Program, as implemented under the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-142) or other state or federal relief programs.” While commercial lenders are required to provide additional documentation to lenders, there are no explicit provisions authorizing the lender to truly uverall, this law dwarfs the CARES Act, provides no liquidity protection for lenders, includes loans on skyscrapers and minivans and purports to allow lenders to negotiate modifications but mandates lenders to provide notice to borrowers of their right to postpone payments until the maturity date of the loan. First steps for all lenders include preparing and sending a notice to every Oregon secured property, identifying any loans already covered, and talking with your attorneys about your options before taking any action on Oregon delinquencies. Lenders on personal property loans where the property is located in Oregon and occupied as a residence have an untenable burden to notice, they must know where the personal property is located. That may work for titled mobile homes, but not for RVs or other vehicles that could be occupied as residences. Stay tuned for a potential executive order extending the end date of the emergency period. Governor Brown must issue such an order by August 31st or the end date will be September 30th. Of course, the legislature could also pass an extension of its own.

    Here is a copy of the enrolled HB 4204.
    Here is a link to Oregon Division of Financial Regulation Guidance for its 1-4 residential property licensees.

    1 For purposes of this law, “financing agreement” includes: “A contract under which a borrower must make payments to a lender to satisfy an obligation that is secured by a mortgage, a trust deed, a land sale contract or a lien or other security interest in subject property; and A retail installment contract, as defined in ORS 83.010, for which the subject matter is personal property that is used as a residence.”nderwrite the documents. Even so, evidence of a loss of income related to COVID-19 is not merely gratuitous. If a lender can show the documentation provided did not provide evidence of COVID-19 related loss of income, the lender might prevail in foreclosure actions. Accordingly, lenders should review and retain all documentation provided in multi-family and commercial transactions.

    The law is unclear about bare land documentation. In the absence of other guidance, we recommend reliance on land use zoning.

    # Foreclosure Moratorium

    A lender may not, at any time during the emergency period, foreclose a lien or other security interest, whether by advertisement and sale or by action or suit in court, and may not enforce a forfeiture of subject property. A foreclosure action initiated prior to June 30, 2020, will be tolled (delayed) until the emergency period ends, at which time it may resume with certain provisions called out for non-judicial trust deed foreclosures and land sale contract forfeitures.

    Additionally, during the emergency period, any purported trustee’s sale or execution sale is void and does not transfer or foreclose any rights to subject property, and courts are prohibited from entering a judgement of foreclosure and sale and from issuing writs of execution on any real property in Oregon or personal property used as a residence in Oregon. Note that the requirement for occupancy of personal property as a residence is not tied to the owner, arguably including any RV located in Oregon if anyone is sleeping in the RV.

    The law does not affect tax foreclosures or foreclosures occurring pursuant to specific abandonment procedures.

    # Borrower Damages

    The law establishes that borrower’s suffering from ascertainable loss of money or property resulting from a lender’s noncompliance are entitled to recover the borrower’s actual damages, court costs, and attorney fees. However, the law does not “relieve a borrower of the duty to repay the full amount of any obligation that is subject to a waiver, deferral, modification or forbearance under the provisions of this section.” Keep in mind that individuals may also be argued to be liable here, because the definition of lender includes every employee, agent, and affiliate of a beneficiary, trustee, mortgagee, seller, retail seller or licensee.

    # Recommended Clarifications

    While there is likely to be another special session of the Oregon Legislature this year, it is less likely that changes will be made to clarify HB 4204. However, if such an amendment were considered, here are some thoughts on how to eliminate some of the more problematic ambiguities:

    Notice related clarification:

    1. The notice required to be sent by lenders should have prescribed language and should:
    2. the language should indicate the accommodations under this law and indicate that taking full advantage of these accommodations may affect the consumer’s ability to qualify for a future loan;
    3. to avoid scams using similar language, include a prohibition barring use of similar language in materials sent to borrowers by persons who are not a lender, as defined, with respect to the borrower;
    4. Clarify that only the current loan servicer needs to mail written notice to borrowers;
    5. Loan servicers should only be obligated to mail written notice to borrowers on transactions secured by 1-4 unit residential properties that were represented as owner-occupied by the borrower at time of origination;
    6. Loans secured by personal property loans should be excluded from requirement to mail written notice, unless secured by mobile homes;
    7. Clarify that notice must only be mailed to one borrower per loan and may be mailed to the last known address of the borrower;
    8. Clarify that no notice must be provided to borrowers on loans made after August 29 (60 days after effective date).

    Other areas where clarification would help:

    1. Bare land and agricultural purpose loans should be explicitly treated as commercial unless zoned for 1-4 unit residential;
    2. Specify that lenders may require modifications for loans covered by the CARES Act to conform to government agency requirements (we want government agencies to continue to buy, insure, or guarantee Oregon loans);
    3. Lenders should be explicitly permitted to deny forbearance to borrowers required to submit financial documentation where the documentation does not show revenue loss to support requested forbearance;
    4. Specify that statutes of limitation in ORS 12.080 and 88.110 are tolled with respect to covered loans for the emergency period;
    5. Clarify that § 10(a)’s reference to notices of a trustee sale given before the emergency period began, extend the exception to all subsequent actions arising from those notices so that it is clear that non-judicial sales conducted prior to the effective date are not rendered void;
    6. Add borrower fraud as grounds for exception under § 10.

    # Conclusion

    Overall, this law dwarfs the CARES Act, provides no liquidity protection for lenders, includes loans on skyscrapers and minivans and purports to allow lenders to negotiate modifications but mandates lenders to provide notice to borrowers of their right to postpone payments until the maturity date of the loan. First steps for all lenders include preparing and sending a notice to every Oregon secured property, identifying any loans already covered, and talking with your attorneys about your options before taking any action on Oregon delinquencies. Lenders on personal property loans where the property is located in Oregon and occupied as a residence have an untenable burden to notice, they must know where the personal property is located. That may work for titled mobile homes, but not for RVs or other vehicles that could be occupied as residences. Stay tuned for a potential executive order extending the end date of the emergency period. Governor Brown must issue such an order by August 31st or the end date will be September 30th. Of course, the legislature could also pass an extension of its own.

    date: "Jan 8th, 2020",

    content: `
    Housing is a fundamental necessity of all people. Access to housing is problematic for many with lower incomes, particularly those with limited English proficiency or disabilities that may require accommodations to even begin the process. Statistical and anecdotal evidence over the years has left little doubt that housing discrimination can take subtle forms that result in material impact.

    As professionals in the financial services and mortgage industry we should constantly promote equal treatment and equal access, as well as monitor for disparate impact. Only by doing so, can we determine whether traditional policies and practices need rethinking to prevent unintended consequences.

    A disturbing report about housing discrimination on Long Island was recently published by Newsday. Front and center in the report is the real impact and prevalence of subtle but insidious discrimination that had a many homebuyers in the study unaware of the extent of the disparate treatment they received and real estate agents in denial of their behavior. Diversity training observed by the reporters was ineffective, if not a mere roadmap to euphemisms to mask the blatant discriminatory intent.

    The Newsday report should sound an alarm throughout the housing industry. It provides a stark picture based on undercover matched pair testing over a three year period on Long Island and should become mandatory reading for financial services and mortgage industry executives as well as for originators and real estate professionals. Disparate impact may not be the exclusive result of statistics, it may be the result of masked disparate treatment. If that is the case, the industry is not just losing out on a lot of good business, it is also contributing to a dangerous trend

    Equally disturbing is a state legislative trend amending the definition of race to include hair texture and protective hairstyles. California and New York have recently amend the definition of race used in anti-discrimination laws related to employment, education, housing, and lending. Wisconsin Representative LaKeshia Meyers, explained the chief concerns of AB 440 are related to employment and educational discrimination. Like California and New York, Wisconsin's definition of race affects housing and lending as well. Oregon's legislature introduced HB 4107, with similar definitional amendments to race, but because of multiple definitions it is targeted to employment and education.

    At first, I hoped this language was anachronistic and wanted to believe we live in a time when such characteristics are not the basis of discrimination, but I have learned such thinking is a symptom of privilege and it compels me to look deeper into the concerns. It is disturbing that in 2020 legislation of this nature is necessary. But it is necessary because members of our communities suffer on the basis of their skin color and national origins. Just like in the Newsday article with respect to housing, in employment and education hairstyle has become a euphemism for race, skin color and national origin, and that cannot be tolerated.

    We are better when we stand together as a diverse society. No one should be discriminated against on the basis of a protected class when seeking to rent or finance housing, or for employment or education. We need to treat others with dignity and respect, pay fair wages and work and build together not apart. Divisiveness is harmful to our business and our communities. I am convinced the housing industry can do more. I hope you will agree and bring about change in your organizations.

    title: "Regulation by Software",
    date: "Sep 19th, 2019",
    name: "regulation-by-software",
    content: `
    The slippery slope of regulation by software has apparently been traversed again. On a call with software developers regarding HMDA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("Bureau") indicated that the Universal Loan Identifier ("ULI") is not case sensitive. However, that conclusion appears to be driven by software development rather than regulations. I believe it is an inappropriate determination under the regulation, particularly since the Regulation's Appendix C shows mixed case characters.

    # Three parts of the ULI

    The regulation at 1003.4(a)(1) defines the parameters of the ULI. It is composed of three parts, beginning with the Legal Entity Identifier ("LEI") issued by the Global LEI Foundation, which may not presently rely on case sensitive characters but could at some future date. The second part consists of 23 characters that are unique to the financial institution. The third part is a two-character check digit.

    Regulation C does not explicitly restrict the uniqueness of the 23-character financial institution identifier to case insensitive use of letters. It merely states that this portion of the ULI:

    “(1) May be letters, numerals, or a combination of letters and numerals;
    (2) Must be unique within the financial institution; and
    (3) Must not include any information that could be used to directly identify the applicant or borrower.” 12 C.F.R. § 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(B).

    Regulation C does not say, and neither do the appendices or official interpretations, that the letters must be uppercase or lowercase, or that the use of letters distinguished by case does not establish sufficient uniqueness.

    The Bureau could argue that the regulation says only “letters” and both “A” and “a” are the same letter. But both uppercase and lowercase letters are also distinguishable letters that meet the definition by creating uniqueness. The Bureau's use of mixed case letters in the example showing how to calculate a check digit in Appendix C further suggests that mixed case was permissible.

    # Mixed case letters are unique in computer software

    The ASCII/Unicode decimal code for an “X” is 88 and for an “x” is 120, these may be the same letter, but they are unique when stored or transmitted on any computer in the format dictated by the Regulation. As are the rest of the alphabet’s values for upper- and lower-case letters. The Bureau would have to implement specific software code to determine otherwise, even if that is merely setting a property of the method to determine whether case sensitive or insensitive comparison is used.

    # The check digit doesn't have to be unique

    In the regulation, only the 23 digit middle section of the ULI has to be unique. Not so with the last two digits of the ULI that form the check digit. Even so, the check digit is probably why the Bureau determined the financial institution number should be case insensitive. After all, the check digit formula relies on a substitution of numerals for letters where the substitution is case insensitive. In other words, you substitute 10 for an "A" as well as for an "a" and 11 for a "B" as well as for a "b", etc. However, the mere fact that two unique ULIs could have the same check digit does not destroy the uniqueness of a base identifier with different case letters.

    In fact, with only two numeric digits for the check digit, it is a given that millions of unique ULIs will have the same check digits.

    # Why does the Bureau think the ULI should be case insensitive?

    So, why would the Bureau suggest that a ULI’s 23-character institution unique identifier should be case insensitive? There is a possibility that the Bureau’s HMDA software doesn’t actually have a limitation on case distinction for uniqueness. It could be that Bureau staff saw the check digit calculation as a limitation and assumed it would be a problem. I made that assumption myself in an earlier blog post regarding how many loans a company can make with a unique ULI. However, as discussed above, the fact that the software converts a ULI to uppercase to validate the check digit should not inhibit case sensitive uniqueness. Perhaps the Bureau has software that ignores the case of ULI letters when tracking the ULI in subsequent purchases and reporting the analysis of HMDA data. If so, that software should be revised to handle case sensitive uniqueness to conform to the regulations, which have no such restriction.

    # We don't need case sensitive values to make more possibilities

    As my earlier posts have indicated, the ULI supports an enormous number of loan transactions. Even without case sensitivity, it is unlikely that a lender will ever need more unique combinations if they implement a disciplined approach to allocation. However, erosion of the discipline of rulemaking and regulation through software development is a landslide waiting to happen. I raise this as a voice of concern that regulations should not be promulgated through software implementations.

    For eight years during a career shift, I designed loan origination software used by three top ten mortgage lenders. During that time I learned how compulsively programmers narrow scope so they can code for a known set of determinants. But the law does not work like that. Under HMDA and most other regulations, the absence of a prohibition or substantive directive is generally treated as permissive. Thus, absent a clear indication that a letter's case is not unique, it should be treated as satisfying the uniqueness requirement of HMDA.

    # The legal code is the law, the software code is merely a fact

    Courts read and interpret the code of law. When courts access software code through expert witness testimony, that computer code should only reveal facts in a case. The computer code should never reveal a unique restriction of the law by which other facts are measured. Software implementations must account for the scope of the regulation, not the other way around.

    Regulation C dictates the data format and content of an electronic HMDA submission. The software used to upload the data must allow for any submission that meets those minimum standards. And, if regulatory agencies cannot accommodate the scope of the law in the software they develop, they need to put the industry they regulate on notice through rulemaking to clarify the restrictions they intend to impose.

    In my opinion, It is important to oppose regulation by software in its earliest forms because software can become even more difficult to change than the law. We need to prevent it from becoming an invasive species and overruling our legal system.

    title: "South Carolina's H 3627 Misunderstands Mortgage Math",
    date: "Jan 21st, 2019",
    name: "south-carolina-h3627-misunderstands-mortgage-math",
    content: `
    South Carolina H 3627 proposes penalty of 3x payment if mortgagors fail to apply at least 30% of a mortgagee's loan payment toward the principal balance of the loan. In so doing, it both mislabels borrowers as mortgagee and lenders as mortgagors (it's the opposite) and misunderstands the mortgage math, which dictates that two factors, 1) the interest rate and 2) the term of the loan, work together to determine the amount of principal in each payment when amortizing a loan. The amount of principal starts low and increases throughout the term of the loan. The longer the term of the loan, the lower the initial percentage of principal in the payment. Imposing a minimum principal ratio in payments has the effect of setting interest rate caps on transactions of a given term. The penalties in H 3627 would shut down lending when rates exceed the effective caps and have calamitous effect on property values. Thus, H 3627 is a stark reminder to be vigilant in watching state legislation to prevent significant harm to consumers and the industry that serves them.

    # Effect on 30-year mortgages

    The effect on a 30-year mortgage is that an interest rate of 4.02% per annum will result in at least the first payment with less than 30% principal. Take for example, a 30-year fixed rate $100,000 loan at 4.02% interest, the payment, rounded to the nearest penny, is $478.57. Interest on $100,000 at 4.02% is $4,020.00 per year or $11.16667 per day on a 360-day year. Making one month's interest (30 days) $335.00. Take the payment of $478.57 and subtract the interest to get $143.57 in principal, which is 29.999791% of $478.57. That is less than 30% so the penalty would be three times the payment amount or $1,435.71. As the rate increases, the number of payments with less than 30% principal increases. A rate of 4.25% has less than 30% principal for the first 27 payments. 4.5% has 39 payments with principal less than 30%. I bought my first house with a mortgage at 12.5%, that would have had the first 244 payments over 30%.

    # Servicing practices compound the risk

    But wait, that payment was based on 360 days per year and there are 365 or 366 days in an actual year. If a servicer were not using a 360-day year and instead calculated its payment based on an 365 or 366 day year then the principal percentage would vary based on the month the payment was being made. A payment in February would have a higher principal amount than a payment made in January, March, or any of the other 31-day months. But there is more, the percent of principal also depends on whether the interest is charged through the date the payment is due, known as scheduled payment application (used in the preceding examples) or charged through when the payment is received, known as actual payment application. In actual payment application, the percentage of principal is dependent upon when the borrower makes the payment. Late payments one month have lower principal percentage because there are more days of interest applied in that payment. But a timely payment the next month would have a higher principal percentage because there were lesser days in that payment. H 3627 would reward borrowers with three times their payment amount for making payments late under the actual payment application approach.

    Interest and principal ratios result from mathematical formulas that vary when interest rates rise and fall. Fixing the ratio by law would have the effect of setting an interest rate cap. A loan with a variable rate could have compliant payments initially and be out of compliance when the interest rate increased.

    # But wait, there's more... what constitutes a payment?

    But that isn't all that is wrong with this bill. As drafted the borrower (mortgagor) has to pay the lender (mortgagee) three times the payment if they don't pay enough principal. Assuming that gets revised, the bill doesn't say whether the basis for the 30% comparison is the amount of the principal and interest required by the promissory note, or if it includes taxes, insurance, mortgage insurance, late fees, modification fees, foreclosure costs, or any other charges the consumer may be paying along with their payment. The number of payments with principal less than 30% described above are based only on the principal and interest portion of the payment. If the language of H 3627 were taken literally, any "payment on a loan secured by a mortgage" would have to have a 30% principal reduction. So, a borrower making a federally required contribution to make up a shortage in a tax escrow account after annual escrow analysis could argue that payment was subject to treble the amount in penalty if the lender didn't apply 30% of the money to principal. Of course, this would be an absurd outcome and a court should find such language constitutionally overbroad and require it to be narrowly construed. But would it be so narrow as to exclude the taxes and insurance escrows included in a regular monthly payment? And that doesn't address handling partial payments.

    # Effects of H 3627 on mortgagors - residential and commercial

    If H 3627 passed in its current form (assuming a reversal of the Mortgagor/Mortgagee mixup), we can anticipate lenders ceasing to make traditional 30-year fixed rate loans in South Carolina when the rate exceeds 4.02 percent and we won't see any 30-year ARM loans either. Traditional 20-year fixed rate loans will dry up at 6.035 percent. That is a lot of South Carolina citizens that will not get a loan. But more importantly, it is a lot of homeowners whose property values will plummet when interest rates rise. The higher payments on shorter term loans will make qualifying more difficult and push buyers out of the market dropping demand and devastating the market values of real property. All real property, because this bill applies to all mortgages, not just residential loans.

    # Get involved and protect both industry and consumers from unintended consequences

    The bill highlights a problem with legislators drafting bills with little understanding of the complexity of the topics being addressed. Mortgage laws require an understanding of the time value of money and the unanticipated effects of imposing linear math in statutory limitations. Historically, lobbyists from the affected industry reveal these types of problems and get them cleaned up before becoming law. Many bills die in committee, they may even be drafted knowing full well they will not get any traction, but they must be monitored and managed, nonetheless.

    Bill's like H 3627 require the industry to be vigilant. Paid lobbyists may not know the math behind the mortgage, but mortgage professionals do. Get involved in local trade associations, join the legislative committees. Review the bills introduced in your state's legislature that could affect your livelihoods every day and speak up when you see something like this. Better yet, meet with legislators regularly, call them and remind them that if they have questions you can help them understand the industry perspective. Become a resource and fewer bills like South Carolina's H 3627 will be introduced.

      "Lead Provider Concerns Raised by California DBO Enforcement Actions",
    date: "Oct 23rd, 2018",
    name: "lead-provider-concerns-raised-by-california-dbo",
    content: `
    The California DBO has been aggressively enforcing the CFL without clarifying lead provider ambiguities in the law. Lead providers are no longer an emerging industry, they constitute core marketing in this digital age, yet the California Financing Law (“CFL”) is an analog statute with relevant provisions passed by the California legislature before IBM introduced the personal computer.
    
    Under the Department of Business Oversight's (“DBO”) interpretation of the CFL revealed in the Consent Order in the matter of the Commissioner of Business Oversight v. Advance America, Cash Advance Centers of California, LLC (the "AA Order" published in March 2018), lead providers are deemed to be brokering CFL loans and subject to licensing if the leads contain any "Confidential Data" as defined therein and discussed below. CFL licensees cannot pay unlicensed brokers, so they cannot purchase leads with Confidential Data unless the lead provider obtains a license. Once licensed, the lead providers, as CFL brokers, are prohibited from receiving payment with respect to a lead unless a loan closes.
    
    # Regulation by Enforcement
    
    By policy only communicated through enforcement actions, the DBO is prohibiting CFL licensee acquisition of Confidential Data from any source other than a licensed CFL broker. However, rather than promulgate regulations to put all licensees and lead providers on notice, the DBO appears to be attempting to derail the lead provider train through enforcement actions that focus on one licensee or provider at a time. If you hold a CFL license or generate leads for consumer or mortgage lenders in California, hopefully the article will shed some light on the subject when you are still outside the tunnel.
    
    The following assessment does not evaluate the conduct of the respondent in the AA Order, the existence of the consent order indicates a settlement, not a fully adjudicated holding of a court or the Commissioner. However, the DBO's position is forefront. Accordingly, we do not opine on the conduct of Advance America, but on the apparent interpretations and enforcement stance of the DBO. Lead providers should pay close attention to these DBO enforcement actions. As they have become more frequent in 2018 than in the past. The legislature has also considered reformation of the CFL in two recent bills discussed further below. The committee summaries of both bills provide powerful statements that the CFL is currently either silent or confusing on the issue of whether online lead providers require a license as a CFL broker.
    
    # Confidential Data as defined by AA Order
    
    The AA Order prohibits the respondent from "paying compensation to a person or company not licensed as a broker under the CFL or otherwise exempt for a referral or lead, if the referral or lead includes or is accompanied by Confidential Data." AA Order paragraph 8(f), p 6. Under the Order:
    
    "Confidential Data is information about a borrower, prospective borrower or applicant (Applicant) that is nonpublic and sensitive. Confidential Data includes, without limitation, the following:
    
    - bank account numbers or routing numbers;
    - bank statements, creditor debit card account number;
    - self-reported or official FICO score;
    - full or partial social security number;
    - self-reported or verified income information;
    - driver’s license number or government-issued identification number;
    - passport number;
    - employment data or history;
    - date of birth, mother’s maiden name;
    - medical information;
    - health insurance information;
    - insurance policy number; or
    - taxpayer or employer identification number.
    
    Confidential Data does not include:
    
    - name;
    - physical address;
    - phone number;
    - email address;
    - desired loan or financing amount; or
    - stated purpose for loan or financing." Id.
    
    Because the list of confidential data is non-exclusive, the respondent and other CFL licensees have some guidance as to what data is prohibited, but the DBO can add other similar data elements at will. The only part the respondent and thus the industry can rely on is what is not confidential data. That includes: name, address, and phone number, the analog equivalent of telephone book data, two pieces of information that barely reveal the consumer is interested in a loan, and the consumer's digital age address, their email.
    
    Date of birth is prohibited and age is not listed, but likely to be lumped with confidential data or deemed a fair lending risk, so we suggest a simple question of whether the consumer is a minor or emancipated to determine whether the consumer is able to enter a binding contract and to be prepared for the California Consumer Privacy Acts requirements with respect to minors.
    
    Ultimately, the problem with the AA Order is that it isn't the law, it is just an agreement between the DBO and the respondent that sheds light on the DBO's interpretation without imposing the specific restrictions on all participants. That said, it should not be ignored. The DBO has entered many more consent orders and stipulations and has more in the works.
    
    # Clarity Required
    
    The industry needs clear guidance on what conduct constitutes brokering a CFL loan. That can only come from DBO rulemaking in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act or a fully adjudicated enforcement action. Unfortunately, the DBO does not seem interested in rulemaking. So here is what the industry as a whole needs to think about as each lender or lead provider settles their case rather than pursing a fully adjudicated outcome that creates case law for all.
    
    # What constitutes Brokering?
    
    Does enforcement provide clear guidance on what conduct constitutes brokering a CFL loan, this includes a definition of what constitutes: a) negotiating a loan, and b) a loan application. Is selling consumer provided lead information the same as taking a loan application? If the consumer knows the data is being used to find a lender, does the consumer even think they are making application for a loan.
    
    A key element in the CFL definition of broker is negotiating. In correspondence with one license applicant, the DBO cited what it called the primary case on the “finder” exemption under California securities law's definition of broker, Lyons v. Stevenson, 65 Cal. App.3d 595 (1977). The case distinguishes mere finders from brokers based on whether they negotiate the transaction. In the referenced correspondence, the DBO cited favorable discussion related to negotiating but failed to acknowledge substantive elements leading to the court's holding that the party was a finder and not a broker because there was no further involvement after the introduction of the parties. Under Lyons, today's CFL lead providers are arguably much more like finders than brokers.
    
    Additional light on the definition of broker was provided by the California legislature in the pilot small loan finder program which falls within the CFL. This describes certain activity that does not constitute a finder because it rises to the legislature’s understanding of brokering. The DBO does not appear to have addressed those points in any lead provider enforcement action I have reviewed.
    
    # What constitutes a loan application?
    
    Presently, the CFL rules do not define a loan application. Without directly stating it, under the AA Order, the DBO treats a single Confidential Data element as triggering a CFL loan application, which is what allows the prohibition of paying for the lead under the CFL.
    
    In very recent correspondence conditionally offering a CFL broker license to an applicant, the DBO relied heavily on the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (“SAFE Act”) to define what constitutes an application.
    
    However, the SAFE Act refers to licensing individual originators (which the CFL was amended to address). Whereas, the CFL applies to unsecured loans as well as mortgage loans. The particular recipient of this letter had not elected to obtain mortgage broker authority, which requires a separate request on the license application. Additionally, the SAFE Act requires individual mortgage loan originators to be licensed. The CFL licenses both companies and individuals. The only individuals required to be licensed under the CFL are those brokering or making mortgage loans.
    
    Moreover, the SAFE Act was passed in 2008 and the relevant CFL language was in effect in 1981, when prior law was re-codified into the Consumer Finance Lenders Law. The same language was again re-codified into the California Finance Lenders Law in 1995. Thus, the SAFE Act could not possibly have influenced legislators at the time of passage.
    
    Interestingly, there are two types of applications contemplated in the CFL, license applications and loan applications. The DBO has argued that a CFL license application is not complete until all information necessary to make the final decision is in the DBO’s possession, even though the CFL regulations define a license application. This interpretation is diametrically opposed to the DBO’s enforcement actions suggesting a single data field triggers a loan application, even though the CFL regulations do not define a loan application. Apparently, the DBO wants it both ways.
    
    # Should payment be restricted to closed loans?
    
    The CFL statute reads: “No licensee shall directly or indirectly charge, contract for, or receive any interest or charge of any nature unless a loan is made.” Cal. Fin. Code § 22300. Clearly this language is broad. Yet, obviously, this language should not prevent a licensee from selling a consumer a bottle of water or a candy bar from a vending machine on its premises. Likewise, it shouldn't prevent a lender from leasing a building from another licensee. But either of these scenarios could conceivably fall within the broad statutory language. When statutory language is at risk of being unconstitutionally over broad, it should be interpreted more narrowly to remain enforceable.
    
    Section 22300 could be more narrowly construed to apply to payments from consumers. Doing so would meet the general intent of consumer protection without preventing licensees from buying modern marketing leads. The consumer would be protected from paying fees for services that did not result in a loan. The intended recipient of the CFL's protection is the consumer, not another licensee. A CFL licensee need not be protected from paying for a lead from another licensee when the consumer does not get a loan, that happens every day (even back in the 1980s) when paying for advertising. But the DBO construes this section to prohibit payments from other CFL licensees when Confidential Data was transferred presumably because it considers that brokering activity. That is a very specific interpretation that would be best promulgated as a regulation under the APA.
    
    The DBO's interpretation has the effect of restricting the sale of a lead to a CFL lender to information of next to no value, by only allowing payment for closed loans when Confidential Data is included in the data set. If the DBO wants lead providers to obtain CFL licenses, it should allow CFL licensees to acquire leads from other licensees, provided the consumers themselves are not charged by a licensee unless the consumer receives a loan. This interpretation alone keeps lead providers aware of enforcement actions from applying for licenses under the CFL.
    
    # Is the industries present advocacy enough?
    
    Over the past two years the California Legislature has introduced two lead provider bills:
    
    AB 3207 would license lead generators, its language is a bit confusing and potentially leaves lead providers subject to Sec. 22300 which prevents payment before a loan closes.
    
    SB 297 would have registered lead generators, this was much better language because lead generators would avoid the Sec. 22300 restriction that applies to "licensees." Unfortunately, SB 297 died.
    
    Does the industry understand the DBO's policy and interpretations?
    We understand that in 2018 the DBO has obtained at least two internal opinions from its Office of Law and Policy on the topic of lead providers. The internal opinions are not publicly available and appear to be standards adopted by the DBO to implement, interpret or make specific the CFL, effectively constituting a “Regulation.” But, they have not been adopted as a regulation or filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.
    
    # Does the DBO policy actually protect consumers?
    
    Public policy may argue for a narrower interpretation of when lead providers can be paid, thus allowing CFL licensees to buy leads that do not rise to brokered applications. The reason is that the alternative to allowing the lead provider industry to operate under license is that unlicensed lead providers will continue selling leads to CFL lenders without supervision or redirect leads (that may have been sold to CFL licensees) to tribal lenders, offshore lenders, and payday lenders, which generally have higher costs to consumers.
    
    # Conclusion
    
    Ultimately, regulation by enforcement is insufficient guidance and certainty for an industry to operate effectively. It leaves risk takers free to deny the regulator's actions apply to them and conservative participants penalized by inconsistency in the market. The industry needs the DBO to promulgate a rule or for a model case to be fully adjudicated. Until then, the light the DBO shines on its interpretations through enforcement actions are like a train light in a tunnel, where the light only reveals itself when it is too late to avoid the punishing effects that accompany it.

    title: "Favorable PHH decision reinforces Mulvaney email",
    date: "Feb 1, 2018",
    name: "favorable-phh-decision-reinforces-mulvaney-email",
    content: `
    The CFPB's en banc appeal in the PHH Corporation, et al v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau case was [decided today](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/B7623651686D60D585258226005405AC/$file/15-1177.pdf). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the 3 judge panel decision on the constitutionality of a single director but reinstated the panel’s holdings on statutory questions. Thus, the substantive questions regarding RESPA’s section 8 and the statute of limitations were upheld and reinstated by the full court. The court's rejection of Director Cordray's opinion that backed the Bureau Enforcement Division's novel interpretations of RESPA was a timely exclamation point on Acting Director Mulvaney's recent email articulating how things will be different at the Bureau.

    The decision today is great news for the industry with respect to Section 8 questions. The Bureau's novel interpretation of what constituted bona fide compensation was articulately dismissed by the panel opinion, which the full court reinstated today. By reinstating the statute of limitations holding of the panel, today's decision also prevents the Bureau from bringing internal administrative enforcement actions after its authority to do so through the courts has ended.

    This decision is a particularly timely emphasis to Acting Director Mulvaney's recently publicized direction with respect to the Bureau engaging in enforcement actions based on novel interpretations of law. His email, posted as part of an investigative journalism article by [nonprofit ProPublica](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4357880-Mulvaney-Memo.html), states "On regulation, it seems that the people we regulate should have the right to know what the rules are before being charged with breaking them. This means more formal rulemaking on which financial institutions can rely, and less regulation by enforcement."

    In PHH, the Bureau raised novel interpretations of RESPA that reversed a 20 year history of HUD's policy and awareness of reinsurance activity. Director Cordray's opinion rejected the Administrative Law Judge's reliance on 1997 HUD letter specifically addressing reinsurance agreements and instead supported the Bureau Enforcement Division's argument that "it is a violation of section 8(a) when a lender makes referrals to a real estate settlement service provider in exchange for the purchase of 'goods or services - at any price - as consideration for making referrals,' and that such a violation cannot be saved by Section 8(c)(2)." Decision of the Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Administrative Proceeding, File No. 2014-CFPB-0002, Filed June 4, 2015, p 15.

    Acting Director Mulvaney's email also lays out his intentions with respect to enforcement and rulemaking: "When it comes to enforcement, we will be focusing on quantifiable and unavoidable harm to the consumer. If we find that it exists, you can count on us to vigorously pursue the appropriate remedies. If it doesn’t, we won’t go looking for excuses to bring lawsuits." By contrast, Director Cordray's opinion in PHH emphasized the Bureau's aggressive enforcement posture "Enforcement notes that a 'thing of value' which constitutes a kickback for a referral under section 8(a) 'is broadly defined, and includes not only the payment of money in the course of a transaction, but also the very opportunity to engage in the transaction - even one that would otherwise be legitimate and is priced at a fair market value' so that it would naturally tend to yield a fair profit." Decision of the Director, p 15. This appears to be precisely what Acting Director Mulvaney is targeting, enforcement actions that require novel interpretations to transform fair market value transactions into violations.

    The Bureau Enforcement Division's interpretation and Director Cordray's opinion were reversed by the three judge panel and today that reversal was upheld on appeal to the full court. The full court agreed with PHH and in so doing reinforces Acting Director Mulvaney's concerns for the risk to lenders when the Bureau aggressively pursues novel interpretations. The Bureau lost their case in court at great cost to the defendent PHH and uncalculable disruption to the balance of the industry.

    Acting Director Mulvaney's comments were applauded by the mortgage industry that, under Director Cordray, repeatedly complained about novel interpretations in enforcement actions like PHH. However, Acting Director Mulvaney's email does not suggest enforcement will not be vigorous, it simply states that vigorous enforcement will be disciplined and focused on cases where consumer harm is tangible. This should be welcomed by consumer advocates as a focus on areas where consumer harm is frequent and real. It should also serve as a warning to the industry that if the Bureau brings an enforcement action under Mulvaney's leadership, the Bureau will expect to win on well established facts and unambiguous regulation where consumer harm is evident.

    title: "Roadmap to 2018 HMDA Data Leniency",
    date: "Dec 26th, 2017",
    name: "roadmap-to-2018-hmda-data-leniency",
    content: `
    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, OCC, and FDIC recently released statements promising leniency with regard to resubmission of 2018 HMDA data. The Agencies' statements recognize the additional complexity in data collection and reporting caused by new data requirements and mandatory reporting of home equity and commercial business channels. Unfortunately, the statements may be rhetorical unless the Bureau’s new HMDA submission portal's (the "HMDA Portal") software is revised to relax presubmission validation rules and attestations. To achieve the stated leniency objectives, the Bureau should consider the following steps: 1) Relax the HMDA Portal's workflow, and 2) Provide data correction guidance under the safe harbor at § 1003.6(b).

    As presently designed, the HMDA Portal requires creditors to perfect their data and attest to its accuracy prior to submission. The HMDA Portal will be used for the first time in 2018 with the submission of the 2017 HMDA reports. Although time is short, the implementation of these steps would be welcome for 2017 data. With the added complexity of 2018 data fields, creditors will face even greater risk of being forced to attest to the quality of data they may know has problems.

    # Relax the HMDA portal's workflow

    The new HMDA portal submission workflow is as follows:

    1. Creditors upload full HMDA data set (all channels);
    2. HMDA Portal performs validation;

    <pre> </pre>

    - **Syntactical edits** -- validate the correct data format and proper year of filing - data must pass to proceed;

    - **Validity edits** -- validate the values in each data field, including existence of data in required fields, permissible values in each field, and cross-field data dependencies - data must pass to proceed;

    - **Quality macro edits** -- validate the register as a whole, including ratios of types of entries - to proceed, the authorized submitter for the creditor must not only certify to the general accuracy of the data but that s/he has verified the accuracy of all data fields referenced by the macro edits;  
      Assuming Syntactical and Validity edits are passed and Quality edits are certified:
      3-valid. Bureau’s workflow reveals submit button and creditor files report;

    Alternatively, if data fails Syntactical or Validity edits in step 2) or creditor cannot certify quality edits the path continues with:
    3-invalid. HMDA report cannot be submitted (button to submit remains inactive);
    4-invalid. Creditor must make sufficient corrections to pass syntactical and validity edits and to certify quality edits and resubmit at step 1).

    # HMDA Portal workflow changes necessary for promise of leniency to be meaningful

    Unless the Bureau alters its workflow to allow data submission without meeting all data validation testing, the promise of 2018 HMDA submission leniency is greatly diminished. If creditors cannot work out their data integrity problems in advance of the filing deadline they will be forced to file late. Arguably, a creditor that cannot fix its validation issues should have no submission at all, because the only alternative is to certify questionable data.

    Absent amendment, the certification itself leaves little room for leniency. The certification required under the portal has changed. Filers of paper certification used in prior years attested as follows: "I certify to the accuracy of the data contained in this register." When known errors existed, the creditor always had the option to scroll a note on the form warning of potential concerns. The portal requires the following: "All data are accurate, no corrections required. I have verified the accuracy of all data fields referenced by the macro edits." The new certification is made online and there is no field for comments.

    The addition of the personal verification of data fields related to macro edits is significant because those items affect the filing as a whole. One example is Q636 "No more than 30% of the loans in the file should report Action Taken equals 4. Your data indicates a percentage outside of this range." 2018 HMDA FIG p. 147. Individual verification of "the accuracy of all data fields referenced" in 30% of the loans would be impracticable. It is common practice for the data to be systematically reviewed at a macro level when such items are identified.

    # For effective leniency, the HMDA Portal needs the following changes:

    **Relax validity edits requirement** - permit submission of the report even if all the new 2018 data fields are not valid.  
    **Soften absolute nature of certification** - make the quality edits certification less absolute or provide an alternative to acknowledge deficiency and provide a remediation plan.
    Unless the Bureau amends the HMDA Portal workflow it may not know whether data validity problems were the cause of late filings. Amending the workflow to give creditors feedback from validity and quality validation while allowing submission without absolute certification in cases where all tests are not passed would allow the Bureau to identify patterns where creditors struggle with data collection, giving real meaning to the offer of leniency. Presumably, the information available to the Bureau from receiving the imperfect data could provide invaluable feedback for future rulemaking. The risk that the leniency sought may be less than that received should be sufficient to keep creditors motivated to get the data right. Additionally, the inclusion of self-reporting fields should be seen as an invitation to file bad data, but a positive step in self-reporting and as promoting remediation efforts.

    # Provide data correction guidance under the safe harbor at § 1003.6(b)

    Current regulations and guidance focus on how the data must be submitted, with little guidance on what to do when that is not the case. Creditors obviously need to report the data they have accurately, but sometimes the data a creditor has just isn't accurate. When data correction is necessary, creditors need guidance in what assumptions they are permitted to make about absent or incorrect data.

    With the inclusion of § 1003.6(b) Congress acknowledged that a creditor's data may not always be perfect. Data correction is not always possible because consumers are notoriously uncooperative post-closing, and may have reported conflicting data. Additionally, software systems that do not reveal inapplicable fields to users may leave those fields blank. In such cases, is a creditor permitted to substitute data for consumer supplied fields or to affirmatively supply "NA" without manually validating blank data fields? Or, will systematic data corrections made to meet validation rules lead to a robo-signing like enforcement actions? In the absence of official guidance on permissible data correction practices, creditors are justifiably concerned as the 2018 data fields enhance the complexity of HMDA reporting.

    To correct data prior to submission, creditors will have to either:
    Find transaction discrepancies and correct them;  
    Collect new information, which consumers may not be willing to provide;  
    Make after the fact systematic assumptions related to identified flaws in system design; or  
    Report fewer than actual transactions if transactions identified by the Bureau with bad data cannot be corrected to pass validation.
    Clarifying that the above approaches to data correction are permissible would be a significant step toward mitigating the compounded risk of additional HMDA data collection. But as the HMDA Portal workflow now stands, the § 1003.6(b) exception cannot be acknowledged at the time data is submitted and validated. Instead, it must be relied upon as a defense for attesting to data with known conflicts.

    Additionally, it is conceivable that a defect in the HMDA Portal software could cause validation failure when creditors' data is accurate. Defects, once identified, can be corrected, but the impact on a creditors filing has not been addressed by the safe harbor. Load testing hadn't been performed on the HMDA Portal as of September 2017, but hopefully it will be capable of handling the filing when it must be submitted. The safe harbor provision should clarify that creditors are not responsible for a late filing in the event the Bureau's software fails.

    # Conclusion

    Ultimately, the new HMDA Portal is a valuable tool for the Bureau and the industry. It is about to be placed in production and both industry and the Bureau need to watch its performance closely. However, the software governing the HMDA Portal's workflow has enhanced HMDA risk by barring initial submission of HMDA reports until after data has been corrected and certified. For the promise of leniency to be effectively carried out the HMDA Portal's submission workflow needs to be relaxed to allow creditors to submit data without making false statements and § 1003.6(b) safe harbor guidance should be enhanced to instruct creditors in what corrective actions are permissible.

    Opportunity for you to influence new regulations prior to notice and comment period. In my role on the Oregon Division of Financial Regulations' Rulemaking Advisory Committee for the drafting of the permanent regulations implementing the Mortgage Loan Servicer Practices Act (MLSPA), I want to provide persons impacted with an opportunity to provide feedback before the proposed rule is published.
    
    I participated in the temporary rulemaking advisory committee and got several concerns addressed that are described in another post [available here]().
    
    In the initial meeting of the Rulemaking Advisory Committee we will discuss the following proposed rulemaking topics:
    
    - Calculation of small servicer exemption under
    - Use of Mortgage Call Reports in applications
    - Liquidity, operating reserves, and tangible net worth
    - Borrower rights to inspect DFR records relating to their loan
    - Prescribed text for notices under
    
    I would be happy to hear from impacted parties on these and other topics of concern. A copy of the MLSPA is [available here](). A copy of the Temporary Regulations are [available here](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2ae1a1_c277ac319cbb456ba131a052e9d5c6b3.pdf).

There were two scheduled advisory calls. I was the only participant on first call and there was only one other participant on second call who had not read the draft.

    In the temporary rule, the Division of Financial Regulations was very accommodating to satisfactorily address the following topics:

    1. Clarification that settlement agents and other parties involved in the origination and closing of a loan would not be required to obtain a license. Needed because paying principal, interest, taxes, or other escrows constitutes servicing and a payoff could have met that definition.
    2. Clarification that loans made through a mortgage broker will not count toward the 5,000 loan small servicer threshold for the lender who funded the loan. Needed because loans originated by a lender are excluded, but loans originated by a third party could have been included.
    3. Exemptions for: a) employees of licensed servicers; and b) entities that own mortgage servicing rights, but use a licensed subservicer to conduct all servicing activities. Needed because the statute was silent as to these roles.
    4. Exclude registered agents from requirement to submit fingerprints for background checks. Needed because most registered agents are corporations whose only purpose is to pass on notice and service of process to licensees.
    5. Clarification that delayed or failed license renewal does not interfere with the obligation to process the consumers payments in a timely fashion. Needed because the Oregon Mortgage Loan Servicer Practices Act prohibits servicing without a license, but federal law requires posting payments in a timely fashion. Consumer harm would be greater if the servicer failed to process the payment than if it renewed a license 30 days late.

    I also asked for clarification on these points that were clarified or expect to be addressed in future rulemaking:

    1. Clarify whether attorney’s conducting foreclosure, trustees conducting non-judicial foreclosure, bankruptcy attorneys, or licensed servicers may fall within the definition of residential mortgage loan modification service when conducting those activities. The state confirmed that from that list, only licensed servicers would fall within the definition and must provide the disclosures in Section 14 of the Act. However, this was not clarified in the rule itself.
    2. Clarify how annual notices must be provided under Section 9(1)(i). The state said it would clarify in its permanent rulemaking. This request was designed to allow servicers sending annual notices in January as well as new loans being onboarded to avoid having additional notices being sent mid-year to conform to the permanent rulemaking.

    Final rulemaking will begin later this month.

    title: "Mortgage Compliance Staffing Demand",
    date: "April 5th, 2017",
    name: "mortgage-compliance-staffing-demand",
    content: `
    The CFPB has recently required both depository institutions and independent mortgage companies to increase their compliance staff. A number of companies are struggling to understand how many compliance resources are needed. We think ratios are a crude and relatively ineffective tool in this evaluation. Lenders have diverse needs for compliance staffing based not only on the jobs the compliance staff perform but also on the company’s overall culture and operating model. A combination of an integrated and modular approach to compliance management can help diminish the total staffing needs while allowing the organization to appropriately budget for growth.

    The keys to an effective compliance management system are:

    1. Identifying problems before they become widespread,
    2. Effectively discovering and correcting the root cause to prevent recurrence,
    3. Testing to insure the corrections are effective, and
    4. Documenting the process to show examiners that appropriate controls are in place.

    Not surprisingly, those are also objectives of operating an efficient and profitable organization that reports its corrective actions to senior management.

    Compliance management necessitates the alignment of a company’s operations to its policies and procedures. Absent such alignment, oversight through additional staffing is inefficient at best and potentially futile. Experience shows that alignment is much harder to achieve through dictated mandates from the compliance department. Technology can be a significant aid but is not an end all solution.

    An organization that engages employees in continuously improving procedures is more likely to achieve the goal of maintaining alignment of operations and procedures. This allows the organization to rely on those procedures for compliance purposes as well as for strategic business planning.

    We recommend a process diagram along with procedure and training manuals. A process diagram that is truly aligned with the operational process allows management to readily visualize the present and future operations. This empowers management to implement effective change for compliance corrections as well as for rapid growth or strategic posturing.

    Absent continuous alignment of procedures and operations, change requires an expensive and time consuming assessment of the present state of operations before the company can begin making changes. Misalignment also opens the door for multiple undocumented alternative processes, which can lead to changes being ineffective in all but the one instance that prompted the change. This may be compounded if post corrective monitoring assumes a uniform process yet detects ongoing violations and errantly reports the change as ineffective.

    With the right approach and discipline, organizations can have a best in class compliance management system that enhances management’s flexibility and strategic response times. Staffing is distributed throughout the organization by utilizing all departments in a coordinated effort including IT, Operations, Quality Control, HR, Accounting, Strategic Development, Production, and Compliance.

    We believe that a compliance initiative should help a company grow rather than hold it back. Our experience with large and small company process re-engineering and workflow modeling allows us to provide any level of support in your CMS design and policy and procedure alignment projects.

      "Can You Outsell HMDA's Universal Loan Identifier and Dwarf the ULI?",
    date: "April 4th, 2017",
    name: "can-you-outsell-hmdas-universal-loan-identifier",
    content: `
    Will HMDA's 23 character ULI handle production when the ULI can never be reused in the future? What if 18 characters are taken up by a non-consumer identifying substitute for the MERS ID, leaving only five? What happens when we add branch identifiers? We did the math. Your sales team has room to grow.

    Recently we have repeatedly been asked if there is enough space to create unique loan id numbers for the foreseeable future. HMDA changes will require financial institutions making covered loans to create Universal Loan Identifiers ("ULI") that are never reused. The 45 character ULI is composed of a unique Legal Entity Identifier ("LEI"), more info on getting a LEI here, which will precede the 23 character loan identifier and be followed by a two character check digit. If you are concerned that the ULI will not handle your future production, here is what you need to know:

    1. **The 23 characters are all yours.** The LEI precedes the 23 character loan identifier so financial institutions do not have to worry about using the same number as another financial institution.

    2. **ULI vs MERS Identifier.** The ULI uses alphanumeric characters, including the 26 letters of the alphabet (A-Z) not case sensitive, and 10 digits (0-9). That is 36 possible values for each character in the sequence. By comparison, the current MERS loan identifier is 18 characters, the first seven are the organization identifier, followed by a ten character loan identifier and then a single character check digit. So MERS gives companies only 10 digits to work with.

    3. **Exponential math in a nutshell.** When you have multiple place holders with multiple possibilities in each place you determine the total possible outcomes by multiplying the number of possibilities times itself for the number of positions in the sequence. For example in dice, with two six sided die, you have six times six or 36 possibilities. This is because for each number on the first die, there are six possible outcomes on the second die. If you add a third die there are another six times the possible outcomes. Mathematicians use the power to indicate how many times a number is multiplied by itself. For example 6^2 also known as six squared is equal to 6 x 6 or 36. Similarly 6^3 is equal to 6 x 6 x 6 or 216.

    4. **Branch Identifiers take up space.** But you can have up to 1,679,616 (that's 36^4) unique branch identifiers and only take up four characters leaving you 36^19 possible loan numbers.

    5. **Unique over time.** By now you may be asking how long will these numbers last, they have to be unique over time (once used, forever banned). The MERS number cannot be directly embeded in the ULI because it is included on the recorded instrument and could make the consumer identifiable. As a result, you get 36^23 unique possibilities. That is enough for 3.71 sextillion loans per year for a hundred million years while still preserving over 1.6 million unique branch codes.

    6. **Embedding the MERS Id.** If you embed the full MERS number in the 23 digits available for the ULI you will be able to reuse the same MERS number over 120 million times. That is because you can place the MERS number at the beginning and have the last five characters each with 36 possibilities resulting in 36^5 or place the MERS number at the end preceded by the first five numbers that have another 36^5 possibilities. The total is not 36^10 it is only 2 x 36^5 but that still comes close to 121 million possibilities.

    7. **Better MERS embedding.** By moving a branch id outside the MERS number and providing for only 46,656 branches (using three characters) creditors could still make ten billion loans (MERS digits are numeric so it provides a mere 10^10) per year for 1,296 years (36^2) using the last two ULI characters to establish a unique year identifier.

    If your sales team needs a new mantra try out, "Dwarf the ULI."

      "Attention HMDA Filers: You Need a LEI (Legal Entity Identifier). Top 3 Questions about Getting a LEI",
    date: "April 4th, 2017",
    name: "attention-hmda-filers-you-need-a-lei",
    content: `
    Believe it or not the top 3 questions about getting a LEI are: 1. What is a LEI? 2. Where do I get a LEI? and 3. Is getting a LEI free? Hint: t isn't a flower necklace, you can't get one at the airport in Hawaii, and since the government requires it and a third party provides it you know it won't be free. The Legal Entity Identifier is the prefix to the new HMDA Universal Loan Identifier and must be obtained from an approved issuing organization.

    # What is a LEI

    A Legal Entity Identifier ("LEI") is required as part of the HMDA Universal Loan Identifier ("ULI"). The LEI identifies the financial institution within the Universal Loan Identifier ("ULI") required by HMDA beginning in 2018. The LEI is 20 characters long and composed of a four character prefix identifying the issuing organization (LOU), a two character reserved separation, twelve characters identifying the financial institution and a two character checksum than insures it was typed properly.

    The LEI precedes a 23 character loan identifier unique to the financial institution that will be followed by a two character checksum. Together these components form HMDA's 45 character ULI.

    Worried your ULI won't be big enough to support your production? We do the math [here]().

    # Where can I get a LEI

    Financial Institutions can check if they already have a LEI using this LEI search tool. Just type in your company name and click search. If your financial institution does not have a LEI one can be obtained from a LEI issuing organization also referred to as a local operating unit ("LOU"). The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation provides a list of [issuing organizations, LOUs, here some are accredited](http://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/how-to-get-an-lei-find-lei-issuing-organizations#), others are in the process.

    When registering, if your company is owned by another organization, you will need to list parent organizations. Register the parent organizations first. Here is the information you will need to provide the LOU when you register for your LEI:

    - Your Legal Name
    - Other Entity Names
    - Your Legal Address
    - Your Headquarters Address
    - Other Addresses
    - Associated Entities
    - Your State of Formation (Legal Jurisdiction)
    - Your Business Register Entity ID (from the state of formation)
    - Your Legal Form (Corporation, LLC, etc.)
    - Your Entity Status (from the state of formation)

    # Is it free?

    Of course not, and you will need to renew your LEI with the LOU annually.

    content: `
    # Code of Federal Regulations citations

    The Code of Federal Regulations is where federal administrative laws are codified, which are also referred to as “rules.” The Code of Federal Regulations is written by federal agencies authorized by Congress to clarify the statutes that Congress passes. There are 50 titles in the Code of Federal Regulations and most of my readers will be interested in Title 12 - Banks and Banking, including mortgage banking. All of the regulations written by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are found in chapter 10 of title 12.

    Note that if you see a citation referencing U.S.C. instead of C.F.R. you are looking at a citation for the United States Code, not the Code of Federal Regulations. The U.S.C. designation refers to the codification into statutes of acts passed by Congress. This article only addresses regulations.

    # Deciphering the citation is easy once you understand how it is derived

    In citations, the Code of Federal Regulations is abbreviated C.F.R. or sometimes just CFR. The C.F.R. is preceded by the particular title, followed by the part, section, paragraph, and subparagraph designations.

    Our example regulation, 12 C.F.R. § 1026.36(d)(1) was written by the Bureau so we know it is in title 12, chapter 10. It also comes from part 1026 which is referred to as Regulation Z. The § symbol stands for “section” though it refers to the number following the period, which follows the part. Fortunately, the Bureau followed the Federal Reserve’s numbering and naming scheme making identifying the regulation by number or letter easy. The part number, in this case, 1026, is composed of two elements: a) the 10 is the chapter of title 12, and b) the 26 is the 26th letter of the alphabet, Z. When writing the citation, the title comes before the “C.F.R.” and the part comes afterward, so 12 C.F.R. § 1026 is title 12, chapter 10, letter 26. The chapter and letter are described together as part 1026 for Reg. Z.

    Using the same code you can easily decipher that the regulations written by the Bureau for HMDA found in Reg. C are cited as 12 C.F.R. § 1003, because C is the third letter of the alphabet (chapter 10, letter 03). Similarly, we know that 12 C.F.R. § 1024 refers to Reg. X, because X is the 24th letter of the alphabet.

    Looking back to our original citation, 12 C.F.R. § 1026.36(d)(1), we can now add that we are looking at section 36 because the 36 follows the period. Paragraphs within sections are further delimited by parenthesis. So we want subparagraph 1 of paragraph d. We read this as “twelve CFR section ten twenty-six point thirty-six dee one.” In a hierarchical table it breaks down like this:

    <pre>
      Title 12
        Part 1026 (Chapter 10 Reg Z – 26)
          Section 36
            Paragraph d
              Subparagraph 1
    </pre>

    # The order of things - How new rules are published

    1. The Federal Register first publishes new and amended regulations.
    2. The eCFR is an unofficial compilation of regulations published in the Federal Register. The eCFR is published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register and the Government Printing Office. The eCFR contains all 50 titles of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    <pre>
    </pre>

    - Note that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s eRegulations are another unofficial compilation generated by a tool designed by the Bureau and 18F. 18F is an office in the federal government’s General Services Administration headquartered at 18th and F streets in Washington D.C. 18F’s mission is to help other federal agencies build, buy, and share efficient and easy-to-use digital services.

    <pre>
    </pre>

    1. Annually, the Official Code of Federal Regulations is compiled and published by the Government Printing Office.

      "CFPB eRegulations Parsing Errors (Part 2 of 2) - Where and How to Verify eRegulation Text",
    date: "August 4th, 2016",
    name: "cfpb-eregulations-parsing-errors-part-2",
    content: `
    The Bureau’s eRegulations parsing errors were the topic of user tips in my previous post. This post describes where and how to verify the text. For the purposes of this article, we examine the parsing error in the header of 12 C.F.R. § 1026.36(d)(1). The eRegulations heading reads “Payments based on transaction terms or conditions.” However, it should read “Payments based on a term of a transaction.” We will look at each step of review showing how we know the eRegulations are wrong and explain along the way where to look for the proper language.

    # Where to verify the text of regulations

    **Regulations are first published in the Federal Register.**
    The writing of regulations is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act which requires final regulations to be published in the Federal Register. The Federal Register is a daily publication of the Government Printing Office. When final regulations are published, they either: 1) describe the completely new regulation text with previously unused parts, sections, paragraphs, etc. or 2) describe amendments to existing regulations by describing what text is deleted and what text is added, including the specific citation of where that text belongs.

    For a primer on understanding citations in the Code of Federal Regulations see my post on [Understanding Federal Regulation Citations](). It uses the same example we will use here, 12 CFR § 1026.36(d)(1).

    In our example, Reg. Z was revised by final rule published in the Federal Register, 78 Fed. Reg. 11280, 11411, (Feb. 15, 2013). That is Volume 78 of the Federal Register, published February 15, 2013 beginning at page 11280 and the page where our particular change is referenced is 11411. This final rule language amended the Federal Reserve Board’s originator compensation rule, aligning it with Dodd-Frank’s elimination of a reference to “conditions.”

    To view the appropriate section of the Federal Register, follow these steps:

    1. From the eRegulations interface, click on the "Regulation Timeline" icon at the top of the left side of the screen (it looks like a clock next to a list).
    2. Under the date of the section you are viewing there will be a published date under the heading “final rule.” Click that published date.

      - For our example, click on the regulation timeline version effective date of 1/1/2014.
      - Under the 1/1/2014 effective date you will see five publication dates for final rules that were effective on January 1, 2014.
      - Click on the “Published 2/15/2013” link.

    3. The Federal Register website will appear on the landing page for the particular Bureau publication of the final rule. Scroll down in the table of contents to find the relevant section. Note that the relevant section may be described multiple times, in the preamble, as well as the revised rule text. For the official text of the regulation you want to be in the section following the heading “PART 10[] – [] (REGULATION [])” where the relevant part, statute name, and regulation are supplied.

      - For our example, scroll down to PART 1026—TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
      - Under Subpart E and § 1026.36, locate 36(d)(1) Payments Based on a Term of a Transaction. Click on it.
      - Compare the heading to the heading in the eRegulations and you will see that the eRegulations is different.

    That is because it was not updated by the parsing tool to reflect the 2/15/2013 heading that now reads “1.
    Compensation that is “based on” a term of a transaction.”

    4. Now scroll up until you see the instructions for insertions and deletions for the section. Review the instructions to be sure you are properly interpreting the changes.

    For our example, the changes are just above the heading “§ 1026.36 Prohibited acts or practices and certain requirements for credit secured by a dwelling.” The instructions are preceded by black square bullet points. They indicate that “Section 1026.36 is amended by… revising paragraphs (d)(1)…” From those instructions we know that the text we just read should have replaced the pre-existing text for that section.

    Amendments to Supplement I, the Official Interpretations, will be in their own section and you will have to read through the text for the appropriate subsection’s reference. This may take some hunting, which is why the eCFR comes in handy.

    Validating changes since the original Federal Register publication
    We viewed the version of the Federal Register where the particular change was first made. To be sure it has not changed again since that date we would have to do two things:

    - If the original change took place prior to the publication of the most recent version of the official text of the Code of Federal Regulations, review the most recent official text; and
    - Review every version of the Federal Register that updated Reg. Z since the later of:

      - the Federal Register publication with the original change; or
      - the most recent publication of the official text of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    But there is an easier way than that if you trust the eCFR, the GPO's unofficial interim publication. First we describe checking the official Code of Federal Regulation, then we describe using the eCFR.

    # The official Code of Federal Regulations is published annually

    The official Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition) compiles the incremental rules published in the Federal Register and codifies them as law. The Official Code is updated annually with different groups of titles being updated in the first day of each quarter. Banking regulations are contained in Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Titles 1-16 are published annually on January 1, so if the law you want to verify was published before the first of the year, verify by checking the official Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition).

    To view the appropriate section of the official Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition), follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR. Select the desired title.  
      • For our example, select title 12 – Banks and Banking
    2. Select the desired chapter.  
      • For our example, select chapter 10 – Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
    3. Select the desired part.  
      • For our example, select part 1026 – TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
    4. Select the desired subpart. Here you might have to try several subparts to find the one you want.  
      • For our example, select Subpart E.  
      • Note that the subparts are below the list of appendices. That is a little odd, because appendices normally come after the body of the material.
    5. Select the pdf link to the right of the section you desire.  
      • Scroll through the regulation text to the subparagraph you desire. For our example, subparagraph (d)(1) begins in the lower right column of the third page of the pdf (showing page 99 at the bottom of the page).  
      • Note that the language here is the same as in the Federal Register and the eCFR but different from what was in the eRegulations.

    # The eCFR unofficially compiles Federal Register publications throughout the year

    The eCFR is not the official text of the Code of Federal Regulations and it is not the original Federal Register publication of final regulations. However, it is produced by the Government Printing Office and, as of the time of this writing, is more reliable than the Bureau’s eRegulations. Because it eliminates examining every change to a regulation published throughout the year in the Federal Register the eCFR is an effective tool. Use the eCFR only when the Federal Register publication date of the regulations you are reviewing is after the first of the current year. If you are looking for regulations from prior to the first of the year use the official Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition) as described above.

    To view the appropriate section of the eCFR, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to http://www.eCFR.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=browse
    2. Select your desired title from the dropdown field  
      • For our example, select title 12.
    3. Click Go.
    4. Click the parts to view from the table displayed.  
      • For our example, Reg. Z is found in volume 9 which covers chapter X parts 1026-1099. This is where understanding the citations described above really saves time.
    5. The next screen will show a list of those parts and the Regulation description.  
      • Our example will show Part 1026 with a heading of TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)
    6. Click the part number or table of contents link.
    7. The table of contents screen shows the date through which the eCFR is current in red at the top of the screen, usually the business day before viewing.
    8. Scroll down and click your desired section.  
      • For our example, click “§ 1026.36 Prohibited acts or practices and certain requirements for credit secured by a dwelling.” It is in Subpart E.
    9. Scroll down to the subparagraphs desired and compare to the eRegulations.  
      • For our example, scroll to “(d) —(1) ”  
      • Note that the language here is different than in the eRegulations

    # Our example reveals the parsing error in eRegulations

    The fact that the text was revised on February 15, 2013, was indicated by the Federal Register publication we examined. That the 2016 official Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition) has the same text as the February Federal Register indicates the rule has not been revised through January 1, 2016 (or at least that if it did change in that time it was changed back again). The fact that the eCFR has the same text as the 2016 official Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition) indicates the rule was not revised through the day before you viewed it. Thus, the difference in text in the eRegulations must be because the eRegulations are erroneous. By looking up the 2015 Annual Edition you will see that the eRegulations have the old language and the parser somehow skipped the change to the title that was published on February 15, 2013, that took effect on January 1, 2014.

    Official publication of interim updates have to be verified in the Federal Register based on the day they were published, as described above. However, you would have to check every Federal Register publication for the particular regulation since the beginning of the year to bring it current. To streamline this for interim rule validation, use the eCFR. Though not official, the eCFR is more reliable than the Bureau’s current version of eRegulations.

    Using the eRegulations interface should be very appealing at this point because the user experience is so much better than any of these tools. That is precisely the problem. The eRegulations are pretty, easy, and mostly right. But mostly right might not be sufficient to make a significant business decision. In the very least, until the eRegulations parser errors are corrected, verify with eCFR to be sure your decision is based on the law of the land.

      "CFPB eRegulations Parsing Errors (Part 1 of 2) Three Tips for Safer eRegulations Use",
    date: "July 28th, 2016",
    name: "cfpb-eregulations-parsing-errors-part-1",
    content: `
    Parsing errors require users to exercise caution when using the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's eRegulations. Though once a favored tool because of its simple user interface, I no longer advocate its use due to a number of recently identified parsing errors including erroneous headers, faulty subparagraph delineation, and missing links to official interpretations. Hopefully, errors will be corrected soon, but until then follow these 3 tips for safer use.

    When the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "Bureau") first released its eRegulations I was thrilled with the simple user interface and access to context sensitive official interpretation comments and preamble. As a power user of legal research tools and former mortgage origination software designer I appreciated the elegance of the user interface. Unfortunately, I recently encountered several parsing errors that serve to remind us all why the site includes the following disclaimer:

    # Trust, but verify

    The CFPB’s eRegulations tool is an editorial compilation of material and not an official legal edition of the Code of Federal Regulations or the Federal Register. We have made every effort to ensure the material presented in this tool is accurate, but if you are relying on it for legal research you should consult the official editions of those sources to confirm your findings. Nothing in this tool binds the Bureau or creates any rights, benefits, or defenses, substantive or procedural, that are enforceable by any party in any manner.

    # Troubling parsing error example.

    Section 1026.38(a)(5)(iii), describing the closing disclosure’s “Product” field, is cross-referenced by 1026.19(f)(2)(ii)(B) as being one of three factors in whether a new three day waiting period is required when a closing disclosure is revised. Because of the parsing error that fails to distinguish 1026.38(a)(5)(iv), (v) from 1026.38(a)(5)(iii) a user might mistakenly believe the “Loan Type” and the “Loan ID #” were also triggers for a new waiting period; they are not.

    # 3 Tips for safer eRegulations use:

    **1. Check the status of “current law”**. Before jumping to the section of the regulation you want to read, go to the landing page for the regulation you are reviewing. You can get to the regulations landing page by doing one of two things:

    Navigate to http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/ and then select the regulation you want to review; or

    Add the numeric section of the regulation you want to review to the end of the eRegulations main page. For example, for Regulation Z which is section 1026, the URL for the landing page is: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/1026.

    Once you get to the regulations landing page, look under the main heading for the following warning in red font “The Bureau is currently updating the tool to reflect recent changes.” If you find it, the eRegulations may not be current even though you may be looking at what the Regulation Timeline calls “Current Law.” In most cases, the update will take effect in the future and the current law will still be valid.

    Alternatively, click on the "Regulation Timeline" icon at the top of the left side of the screen (it looks like a clock next to a list). If there are dates after the date labeled "current law" there have been changes that take effect on the listed dates. This is a great tool for looking at historic, current and future law. It even lets you compare two versions. But be sure when you are reading the law that you know which version you are in. Select the date closest to but not later than the effective date you wish to review or simply select Current Law. Always keep in mind that if the red updating warning was displayed, the law may be changing though those changes may take effect in the future.

    **2. Read the preceding and subsequent subsections**. If you look in the present release for Section 1026.38(a)(5)(v) you might not find it. That is because there was a parsing error in § 1026.38(a)(5). There are six subparagraphs (i)-(vi) in that subsection but they are displayed as only four (i)-(iv). Subparagraphs (iv) and (v) are appended to the end of subparagraph (iii). Subparagraph (vi) is improperly labeled as (iv). Reading the prior and subsequent sections carefully for subsection delimiters will help you catch such errors. If you find them be sure to report them to CFPB_eRegs_team@cfpb.gov and send a note to me as well, I am trying to keep track and may post a list if I get enough feedback.

    **3. View official interpretations in Supplement I**. The interface includes a link after opening the official interpretations for specific sections of the rule. While it is tempting to simply pop this open read and move on, the safer bet is to click the next link and view the comments in the full context of the official interpretations. You never know what you might be missing. For example, the link to Comment 19(e)(4)(i) takes you to comment 19(e)(4)(ii) and there is no link to comment 19(e)(4)(ii) in the interface. You could easily overlook the actual comment to 19(e)(4)(i) and may not realize you are reading the comment to 19(e)(4)(ii) unless you view the comment in Supplement I. Similarly, the link to Comment 38(a)(5)(v) is missing from the interface. If you do not view the comment to 38(a)(5) in Supplement I you might never know the comment existed. So click the link and review the prior and subsequent entries in the context of Supplement I for safety.

    Bottom line, in the present release, relying solely on the language posted in eRegulations is ill-advised. Even a few reported instances where the rule is improperly parsed suggests reliance on this interface alone is risky. The increased number of parsing errors in recent versions suggests that the errors are compounding with new releases. The fact that errors reported weeks ago have not been corrected raises concerns about the Bureau's priority for accuracy of the tool and their attention to feedback. The lack of a readily accessible log of known parsing errors and history of corrections is also problematic.

    With luck, the Bureau and 18F (an office inside the federal government's General Services Administration that helps other federal agencies build digital services), will get this straightened out and we will all be using eRegulations again with confidence. When properly parsed it is hands down the most effective regulatory research interface I have used. In the meantime, heed the Bureau's own warning, Trust, but Verify.

    title: "Fannie/Freddie UCD on Your Mind?",
    date: "March 31st, 2016",
    name: "fannie-freddie-ucd-on-your-mind",
    content: `
    The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie and Freddie to develop a Uniform Mortgage Data Program of which the Uniform Closing Dataset (UCD) is one component. The goal is to better support the CFPB's new Closing Disclosure. The UCD will contain the data in extensible markup language (XML) format along with a portable document format (PDF) image of the Closing Disclosure. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will accept voluntary submissions no later than Q4 2016 with mandatory delivery no sooner than Q2 2017.

    Here are two compliance risks and strategies to avoid them when implementing and testing your UCD conversion.

    1. If you use a different document vendor than loan origination software vendor, the data on your PDF image may not exactly match the data in your XML file. This is similar to the age old problem of different loan origination and document vendors calculating annual percentage rates with different code, leaving the data submitted to examiners from the loan origination system slightly different than the forms they find in the files. Though both may be within tolerance, any differences may give pause to secondary market investors, examiners, and the courts, if challenged. Test more than just APR, any values that are calculated could have different results.

      You must work with your vendors to correct discrepancies. Alternatively, you can search for vendors that avoid conflict by either: 1) allowing the loan origination software to pass the calculated fields to the document service to include in the document; 2) allowing the document service to pass the calculated value back to the loan origination software to include in the XML; or 3) by having both the loan origination system and the document service calling the same calculation code.

    2. If you simply change fee names to match the UCD descriptions, you may create compliance problems on loans in your pipeline because Reg. Z requires the fee descriptions and order of fees on the Closing Disclosure to be consistent with descriptions on the Loan Estimate. See comment 38(h)(4)-1. A change in the fee name to conform to the UCD could cause a compliance violation if the changed description first appears on the Closing Disclosure. Because fees are listed alphabetically, if the new fee description changes the first letter the order in which the fees are displayed will likely change.

    To address this, test your loan origination software and introduce new fee descriptions for new applications rather than changing existing descriptions. Then retire the old descriptions after running a report showing no active loans with Loan Estimates containing the old fee descriptions. Finally, consider any mapping of fees to your accounting systems during this transition.
