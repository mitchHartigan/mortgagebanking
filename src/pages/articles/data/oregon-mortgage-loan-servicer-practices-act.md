Opportunity for you to influence new regulations prior to notice and comment period. In my role on the Oregon Division of Financial Regulations' Rulemaking Advisory Committee for the drafting of the permanent regulations implementing the Mortgage Loan Servicer Practices Act (MLSPA), I want to provide persons impacted with an opportunity to provide feedback before the proposed rule is published.

I participated in the temporary rulemaking advisory committee and got several concerns addressed that are described in another post available here.

In the initial meeting of the Rulemaking Advisory Committee we will discuss the following proposed rulemaking topics:

- Calculation of small servicer exemption under
- Use of Mortgage Call Reports in applications
- Liquidity, operating reserves, and tangible net worth
- Borrower rights to inspect DFR records relating to their loan
- Prescribed text for notices under

I would be happy to hear from impacted parties on these and other topics of concern. A copy of the MLSPA is [available here](). A copy of the Temporary Regulations are [available here](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2ae1a1_c277ac319cbb456ba131a052e9d5c6b3.pdf).
